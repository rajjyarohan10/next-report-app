# Proposal for Adding Playwright End-to-End Tests

## Overview
This document outlines how Playwright end-to-end (E2E) tests could be integrated into our Next.js-based applicationâ€™s CI/CD pipeline. While the current scope does not include immediate implementation, these steps provide a clear path for adding automated E2E coverage in the future.

## Purpose of Playwright
- **Validate User Flows**: Ensures critical paths (login, navigation, form submissions, etc.) work as intended.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit to verify consistency across major browsers.
- **Enhanced Confidence in Releases**: Catches UI regressions early, reducing production issues.

## Proposed Steps

### 1. Installation and Setup
- **Add Playwright as a Dev Dependency**: Would require installing the Playwright test runner (e.g., via npm or yarn).
- **Initialize Playwright**: A one-time process generating default configuration files and example tests.
- **Test Folder Structure**: Create a dedicated folder (e.g., `tests/e2e`) for clarity and maintainability.

### 2. Configuring the Pipeline
- **Update or Create a Workflow**:
  - Either extend the existing CI workflow or create a separate file dedicated to Playwright tests.
- **Start the App in CI**:
  - Ensure the Next.js app is running before executing tests. This can be done in the background or via specialized tooling that waits for a successful response.
- **Run Playwright Tests**:
  - Execute the tests against localhost or, if preferred, an already deployed environment (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).

### 3. Test Execution Approach
- **Localhost Testing**: Builds and serves the app locally within the CI environment, then points Playwright to `http://localhost:<port>`.
- **Deployed Environment**: Leverages a deployment URL, removing the need to start the app. This can simplify the workflow but requires that the site be deployed first.

### 4. Handling Artifacts and Reports
- **Screenshots, Videos, and Trace Files**: Playwright offers robust debugging artifacts. These can be uploaded as job artifacts in GitHub Actions for troubleshooting failed runs.
- **Test Reports**: Store results in logs or leverage third-party reporting for deeper insights.

## Considerations and Challenges
- **Time Constraints**: Implementation requires script setup, pipeline adjustments, and writing meaningful test cases.
- **Server-Side vs. Static**: For Next.js apps with server-side rendering or dynamic routes, ensuring a consistent test environment might need additional configuration.
- **Secrets and Environment Variables**: Sensitive data (API keys, user credentials, etc.) must be handled securely, typically via GitHub Secrets.

## Conclusion
By following the steps highlighted here, we can seamlessly integrate Playwright into our existing workflow. This will provide an additional layer of quality assurance, ensuring our users continue to have a high-quality experience.
